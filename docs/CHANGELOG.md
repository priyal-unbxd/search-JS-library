# v2.1.9

- **Release Date**: 18th June, 2024
- **Core SDK Version**: v0.5.10
- **CDN Link**: [https://libraries.unbxdapi.com/search-sdk/v2.1.9/vanillaSearch.min.js](https://libraries.unbxdapi.com/search-sdk/v2.1.9/vanillaSearch.min.js)

## üêõ Bug Fixes
{: .no_toc}

1. Resolved an issue where clicking on a category filter did not move back to the previous level but instead stayed on the same level. This fix ensures that users can now correctly navigate back to the previous level, enhancing the usability of the category filtering system.
2. Fixed a bug where scrolling down on the category page caused the URL to decode improperly. This decoding issue led to broken pages upon reload. The URL handling has been corrected to maintain proper encoding, ensuring that the page reloads correctly without breaking.
3. Virtualisation has been removed from the sdk. This change may impact the rendering performance for long lists but was necessary to address certain user experience and technical issues. 
4. Addressed an issue with infinite scrolling where reaching the bottom of the page triggered infinite API calls. This fix ensures that scrolling to the bottom now loads content as expected without causing excessive and repeated calls to the server, improving both performance and user experience.

# v2.1.8

- **Release Date**: 12th June, 2024
- **Core SDK Version**: v0.5.9
- **CDN Link**: [https://libraries.unbxdapi.com/search-sdk/v2.1.8/vanillaSearch.min.js](https://libraries.unbxdapi.com/search-sdk/v2.1.8/vanillaSearch.min.js)

## üêõ Bug Fixes
{: .no_toc}

- Fixed `FETCH_ERROR` event handling . The `FETCH_ERROR` event was previously not invoking the `onEvent` handler due to a bug. This has now been resolved, and the `onEvent` handler is correctly invoked for the `FETCH_ERROR` event. Users can now handle errors and perform desired tasks within the onEvent handler when a `FETCH_ERROR` occurs.This update ensures better error management and more reliable event handling within the SDK.

# v2.1.7

- **Release Date**: 13th May, 2024

## üêõ Bug Fixes
{: .no_toc}

- Resolved a major mouse back issue where users on `INFINITE_SCROLL` or `CLICK_N_SCROLL` were stuck in a loop of the same page number when attempting to navigate back. Now, when using infinite scroll or click and scroll, the page numbers are simply replaced in the history stack, preventing the creation of a new entry for simple scroll.
- `setRoutingStrategies` is now removed from the options , and now is rather a prototype method.
- Added `sdkVersion` to the prototype, providing an easier way to determine which version the user is on.
- When `seoFriendlyUrl` was false , the `keyValueSeperator` was taking wrong values , this has been fixed in this release.

## üêõ Bug Fixes
{: .no_toc}

- The `uc_param` param was not being retained in the url on reloading the page.
- Fixed a problem where the `last-page` pagination action/button was not directing to the last page. 
- Implemented additional try-catch blocks for better debugging within UnbxdSearch methods.
- Addressed an issue where, in the case of `seoFriendlyUrl` is true and a `keyValueSeparator` is other than `=`, the category string was not being appended to the URL.
- Adding a fallback (`location.href`) for `history.pushState` in `setRoutingStrategy` to avoid same-origin issue in the google caching pages.

# v2.1.5

- **Release Date**: 5th Mar, 2024
- **Core SDK Version**: v0.5.7
- **CDN Link**: [https://libraries.unbxdapi.com/search-sdk/v2.1.5/vanillaSearch.min.js](https://libraries.unbxdapi.com/search-sdk/v2.1.5/vanillaSearch.min.js)

## üöÄ Features
{: .no_toc}
- onError method now triggers [onEvent](./Methods#onevent) method automatically when an error occurs, providing access to the error payload. Added support for two new events: "CONFIG_ERROR" and "RUNTIME_ERROR". These events are passed down to the "onEvent" method, allowing users to take appropriate actions based on the event type.
- [actionBtnClass](./configurations/FacetsConfig#actionbtnclass) and [actionChangeClass](./configurations/FacetsConfig#actionchangeclass) configurations have been relocated inside the [facet](./configurations/FacetsConfig.md) config object under configurations. Passing of these in main/outer object has been deprecated from this release.
- When the search box is empty and the enter key is pressed, it now triggers the api call with `*` as the query, instead of not triggering a call.
- Introducing two new pagination actions - firstPage and lastPage . Users can activate these buttons by passing the appropriate [data-page-action](./configurations/PaginationConfig#data-page-action) as either `firstPage` or `lastPage` as documented in this [usecase here](./configurations/PaginationConfig#usecase-4).


## üêõ Bug Fixes
{: .no_toc}
- Resolved problem where navigating back to the previous page state on category pages didn't function properly. Now, when users navigate through multiple levels of categories and want to return to the previous level, the SDK accurately retains the previous page state instead of removing everything from the URL. 
- Resolved problem where characters in the Category page URL were being double encoded, resolving disruptions in navigation.
- Improved handling of no results: Previously, the "noresults" block was appended to `searchResultsWrapper` regardless of the presence of `noResultsWrapper` in the DOM. With the recent fix, the "noresults" block will now be appended under "noResultsWrapper" if it exists in the DOM. If `noResultsWrapper` is not present, the `noresults` block will be appended to `searchResultsWrapper` as a fallback.
- Fixed persistent display issue: Previously, the `no results` container remained visible alongside product cards even after querying for results. Now this removal of container from the DOM has been handled properly with this release.
- Corrected the API call behavior when reaching the last page with fewer products than the page size, preventing incorrect start index assignment.
- Initialized `rangeFacets` inside `url` config , which caused facets breaking issues when not explicitly passed by the user.
- `productItemClass` is now made mandatory for retrieving products from the DOM. Directly getting the products under the container , in some cases calcuates incorrect `start`. 
- When noResults page is reached , `start` was getting NAN .

## üöÄ Features
{: .no_toc}
- In this release, we are excited to introduce a powerful enhancement to our e-commerce product listing environment ‚Äî Product Virtualization. This feature is designed to revolutionize the way products are displayed on webpages, offering improved performance and a more responsive user experience. Please click [here](configurations/PaginationConfig#virtualization) to know more about virtualization.
- Within this virtualization system, there is a parameter called `bufferPages`, represented as an integer. When set to 1, the SDK employs prefetching, ensuring that one page of products is maintained ahead and behind the currently displayed page. Please click [here](configurations/PaginationConfig#bufferpages) to know more about bufferPages.
- Introducing Debug Mode for enhanced integration and debugging. This captures configuration and coding errors in real-time, aiding developers during integration. Please click [here](configurations/MiscellaneousConfig#debugmode) to know more about debugmode.


## üêõ Bug Fixes
{: .no_toc}
- Resolved issue causing random product loading and duplication during infinite scroll, ensuring correct product order and improving user experience.
- Fix in reading facet value with special characters as multi value separators. When the facet's multiValueSeparator is configured with some special characters like `|` and copy paste the URL from browser to any notes or social media, the `|` used to get encoded to `%7c`. When these links are clicked from these social media sites, it used to navigate to the URL with `%7c` in it and SDK failed to recognize the same.
- Removal of trailing `?` or `#` (incase of hashMode) when none of the query params are added to the URL. 


## üß∞ Maintenance
{: .no_toc}
- Added ESLint for comprehensive code analysis. This enforces coding style rules, identifies potential bugs, and improves code readability.
- Fix in github actions to run on release tag.
- Removed dependency on node-sass completely 
- Upgraded the node version to 16.14.0

# v2.1.1 - Dynamic Extra Params

- **Release Date**: 25th Oct, 2023
- **Core SDK Version**: v0.5.1
- **CDN Link**: [https://libraries.unbxdapi.com/search-sdk/v2.1.1/vanillaSearch.min.js](https://libraries.unbxdapi.com/search-sdk/v2.1.1/vanillaSearch.min.js)

## üöÄ Features
{: .no_toc}
- In this release, we've enhanced the `extraParams` object used in our config. Previously, this object allowed you to send static key-value pairs to the Unbxd search API. However, we've now introduced the ability to use functions as values. This means that you can dynamically generate and send values to the API with each request. For example, you can now send different segmentation details, currencies, or languages in the request, ensuring that your API interactions are more adaptable and responsive to the specific context and requirements of your application. 

Please click [here](configurations/MiscellaneousConfig) for the more details on the extra params.

# v2.0.38

- **Release Date**: 6th June, 2023
- **Core SDK Version**: v0.4.34
- **CDN Link**: [https://libraries.unbxdapi.com/search-sdk/v2.0.38/vanillaSearch.min.js](https://libraries.unbxdapi.com/search-sdk/v2.0.38/vanillaSearch.min.js)

## üß∞ Maintenance
{: .no_toc}
- **Rewriting Infinite Scroll Pagination**: The infinite scroll rewrite includes pre-loading and post-loading of content based on the user's scrolling behavior. It utilizes a separate thread and the Intersection Observer API to observe changes in element intersections, improving performance and providing a smoother scrolling experience. The page number updates dynamically as the user scrolls, and the same set of products is loaded when the page is refreshed. The implementation eliminates delays caused by executing logic within the scroll event and removes dependencies on the user's scroll position, the number of products shown in a row, and the height of the product container. Only the new products are rendered, enhancing rendering performance.
- **Rewriting Click & Scroll Pagination**: The re-write of click and scroll pagination allows users to trigger the fetching of successive pages through clicking or scrolling. The implementation dynamically updates the page and loads only the necessary products, eliminating dependencies on scroll position, product display, and container height. Rendering is optimized by appending or prepending new changes instead of replacing the entire content.
- Separating out the `renderProducts` code to maintain consistency across all the render feature logics.

## üöÄ Features
{: .no_toc}
- **Introducing Page and Count in URL**: A modification has been made to the URL variables used for pagination. Instead of using "rows" and "start" to determine the number of products displayed and the starting index, respectively, the variables "page" and "count" have been introduced. The boolean variable "usePageCount" under the `pagination` config object determines whether to use this new approach (when set to true) or continue using "start" and "rows" (when set to false).

## üêõ Bug Fixes
{: .no_toc}
- Added `uc_param`, `count` and `page` in the `unbxdKeys` list.
- Fixing CSS issues in the demo template.
- Only the newly fetched products are rendered instead of re-creating and re-rendering all the products on every API call, enhancing the rendering performance.
